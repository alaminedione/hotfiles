This repository contains my personal Linux configuration for Hyprland and Sway. My goal for this configuration is to provide a modern, beautiful, productive, and simple workflow with extensive theme support, making it very easy to configure your own themes.

I've created a script (`install.sh`) that allows for a quick installation of my work environment, as well as backup and restoration capabilities.
