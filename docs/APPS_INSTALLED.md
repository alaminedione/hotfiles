## Custom installation

The installation script guides you and lets you customize your environment according to your needs:

- **Developer profile**:  
  If you are a developer, the script offers to install essential tools like `github-cli`, `nodejs`, `python`, `rust`, `go`, `lazygit`, and more.  
  This ensures you have a complete and ready-to-use development environment right away.

- **Extra packages**:  
  You can also choose to install extra applications, useful for a fresh Arch Linux installation, such as `firefox`, `freedownloadmanager`, `onlyoffice`, `qemu`, `meld`, `clapper`, and others.  
  This makes it easy to set up a system ready for daily use, whether for work, multimedia, or office tasks.
